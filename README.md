## My process

I have decided to use the css flex to accomplish most of my work

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla javascript

### What I learned

I have been challenged by position the images while overlapping the the container, some times it was not responsive. Additional I am feeling comfortable with building multiple background using css efficiently. Last, I also became mor comfortable with css variables.

Multiple background as follows:

```css
background: url(../images/bg-pattern-intro.svg) no-repeat 30% 50%/ 200%, linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    var(--gradient-light-red),
    var(--gradient-red)
  );
```
